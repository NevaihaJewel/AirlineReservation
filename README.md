<h1>Airline Reservation System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This C++ program simulates an airline seat reservation system where users can choose between First Class and Economy seating options. It continues until all seats are fully occupied. The program uses input validation to ensure proper seat selection and offers an intuitive seat assignment process. This program demonstrates my proficiency by effectively using control structures, input/output operations, and array manipulation. The clear flow of decision-making and seat assignment in this program showcases my ability to handle real-world problems and efficiently translate them into functioning code.

<b>Key Features:</b>

- <b>User Input Handling:</b> Prompts users to choose a seating class, validates their selection, and assigns seats based on availability.
- <b>Flow Control:</b> Uses loops to keep the program running until the plane is fully booked, offering seat availability updates.
- <b>Error Handling:</b> Ensures users cannot select invalid options, enhancing the user experience and reliability.
